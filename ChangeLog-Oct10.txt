I added the Library into the git, if the project wont build follow this instructions.

1. Make a new android project from source
2. set the root for this project to the library folder in the workspace (i.e Capstone/NAUFitnessApp/library)
3. Right click the new project, go to buildpath -> configure build path
4. Click the libraries tab, verify that the "android-support-v4,jar is listed (should be from FitnessApp/libs)
5. Click on the "Android" tab in the side bar, set the build target to Android 4.0.3 if it is not
6. Verify that "Is Library" is checked then click Ok
7. Right click FitnessApp project
8. Navigate to Android tab in sidebar
9. In the library section click "add" and add the project we just set up (should be the only one listed) click ok.

Other changes in this build:

-Added tab display to main menu (with 3 tabs). Check the source for documentation on how this all works.
